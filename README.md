## API Information

This app uses the OpenWeatherMap API:
- **Current Weather**: `https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather`
- **5-Day Forecast**: `https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/forecast`
- **Units**: Metric (Celsius, km/h, etc.)
- **Rate Limit**: 60 calls/minute for free tier

## Browser Compatibility

- Chrome (recommended)
- Firefox
- Safari
- Edge
- Mobile browsers

## Geolocation

The app uses the browser's Geolocation API to get your current location. Make sure to:
- Allow location access when prompted
- Use HTTPS for production (geolocation requires secure context)

## Demo Mode

If no API key is provided, the app will show a console message about demo mode. You can enable demo mode by uncommenting the demo class initialization in `script.js`.

## Customization

### Changing Units
To change from metric to imperial units:
1. In `script.js`, change `&units=metric` to `&units=imperial` in API calls
2. Update the display units in the HTML and CSS accordingly

### Styling
- Modify `styles.css` to change colors, fonts, and layout
- The app uses CSS Grid and Flexbox for responsive design
- Custom properties (CSS variables) can be added for easy theming

### Adding Features
- UV Index: Requires additional API call to OpenWeatherMap's UV endpoint
- Hourly forecast: Modify the forecast display logic
- Weather alerts: Add API calls for severe weather warnings

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"City not found" error**
   - Check the spelling of the city name
   - Try using the city name in English
   - Some cities may require country code (e.g., "London, UK")

2. **Location not working**
   - Ensure you've allowed location access
   - Check if your browser supports geolocation
   - Try refreshing the page

3. **API errors**
   - Verify your API key is correct
   - Check if you've exceeded the rate limit
   - Ensure you have an active OpenWeatherMap account

### Debug Mode

Open the browser's developer console (F12) to see:
- API request/response logs
- Error messages
- Demo mode notifications
